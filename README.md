# Loan-Default-Risk-Analysis
An exploratory data analysis and risk assessment project on loan default using Lending Club data, implemented in Python with a subsequent predictive model.
## Overview
This project explores loan default risk using the Lending Club dataset. 
The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), risk assessment, 
visualization, and a predictive model to identify bad loans.
## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Lending Club loan dataset,
### Dataset Link

which contains information on borrower characteristics, loan details, 
and loan performance.
## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for EDA and modeling
- `Presentation` – A Report on findings
- `README.md` – Project documentation
## Key Steps
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Risk assessment and visualization
- Predictive modeling
- ## Results
The analysis highlights key factors influencing loan default risk, 
and the predictive model provides an initial approach to identifying 
high-risk loans.
## Future Work
- Improve model performance
- Feature engineering
- Model comparison and tuning
